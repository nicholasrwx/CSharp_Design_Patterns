### **Overview:**

An inner factory is a class that is contained within the object that it is going to build out and instantiate.
It generally remains on the class ( not on the instance ).
This can be useful when you want to provide factory capabilities to build an object which has a private constructor.

### **Classes and objects participating in this pattern include:**

- **Sign**
	- An object that contains values which represent a custom or premade order of signs.

- **Factory**
	- An Inner Factory which contains additional factory methods that allow someone to create a customized order of signs.
